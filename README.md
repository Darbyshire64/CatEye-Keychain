# Cateye Keychain
A PCB i made for an HackClub YSWS Called Solder. The PCB Will Automaticly Dim The LEDS 
when its Bright and Brighten them when its dark. It was made with KiCad 8. The PCB Mesurements are aprox 65mm x 50mm. The PCB has Passed DRC Ki Cad Check with only a via warning for the key hole at the top of the cat.

# How It Works

It takes a 3V Coin Battery. this is fed to an LDR witch controls a transistor that turns on or off the Two LEDs in the cats eyes.

# Pictures

  Some Pictures of the PCB Diagram & Schematics and a 3D Version of the PCB however due to some isssues with my Ki cad install commponennts do not apear in 3d however can actually fit on there.
